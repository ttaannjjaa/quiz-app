# quiz-app

okay, the "official name" is quiz-app, but under the hood it is a learning app you can create for topics you want to keep in mind, but that seem to be some kind of mobile with tendency to swap away out of your brain again...

here is your new strategy

when you learn something - write down the question a teacher could ask you to check whether you kept the most important aspects about...and as you have your learning material in front of you add the correct answer, if you like also some motivational words for especially difficult topics. You can give you also 1 - 4 hints around and then add it to your increasing storage of quiz-app-cards. If you don't know the answer the first time, you can highlight this card with a bookmark at the right upper corner.
