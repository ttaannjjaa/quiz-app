## quiz-app

okay, the "official name" is quiz-app, but under the hood it is a learning app you can create for topics you want to keep in mind, but which seem to be some kind of hypermobile with a tendency to disappear out of your brain ... 

here is your **new strategy**

when you learn something - write down the question a teacher could ask you to check whether you kept the most important aspects about the theme in mind. Because you have your learning material in front of you (desk or display) just add the correct answer, if you like also some motivational words for especially difficult topics. You can give you also 1 - 4 hints around and then add it to your increasing storage of quiz-app-cards. If you don't know the answer the first time, you can highlight this card with a bookmark at the right upper corner, so you can easily see, which are the cards you should the next time more often repeat on the quiz page. Of course you can also play the quiz together with a friend. So you can both support each other finding the correct answer.


**How to start** 
You can choose a username you like (of course not too long) and then push the login-button. There are 4 available pages you can always reach with the navigation at the bottom of the app. The first one is the quiz-app page itself, on the bookmarks page you have the storage of your cards. Next comes the create page, here you find a form, so you can produce more quiz-app cards as described above. At the profile page you can add a picture and some more informations about yourself if you like . Here you also find the logout-button. Have a lot of fun with your new quiz-app ðŸª„
